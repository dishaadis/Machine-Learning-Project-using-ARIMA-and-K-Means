## Project Description
<p align="justify">
The project encompasses two main objectives to address distinct needs within the company. Firstly, the inventory team seeks to enhance their inventory management process by accurately estimating the quantity of products to be sold on a daily basis. This is a crucial aspect of their operations to ensure that an adequate level of inventory is maintained without excess, preventing both stockouts and overstocking. To tackle this challenge, the project will employ machine learning techniques, specifically the ARIMA model, to forecast the time series of product quantities.

Secondly, the marketing team aims to improve customer engagement by tailoring promotions and sales treatments based on specific customer segments. The goal is to deliver personalized and targeted marketing strategies that resonate with different groups of customers. To achieve this objective, machine learning clustering methods, particularly the K-Means model, will be utilized. This approach will help identify distinct customer groups based on various criteria, allowing the marketing team to tailor their efforts effectively. In essence, this project harnesses the power of machine learning to optimize inventory management and refine customer segmentation, ultimately leading to more efficient operations and improved customer satisfaction.
